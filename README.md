# MinhTC.Tech Portfolio

![Portfolio Demo](images/porfolio-demo.webp)

- This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a front-end developer.
- Please give this source a star, thank you so much ü•∞.

## Technologies üîß

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Project Structure üîç

The project follows the Atomic Design pattern for component organization and scalability. The structure is as follows:

```
src/
  - components/
    - atoms/
    - molecules/
    - organisms/
    - templates/
    - pages/
  - app/
  - tailwind.config.js
  - ...
```

- The `components` directory contains atomic components grouped into folders: `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, `templates`, and `pages`. This structure promotes component reusability and maintainability.
- The `app` directory contains Next.js page components that define the routes and layout of the website.
- Classes and styling is configured the `tailwind.config.js` file.
